- Exponentially weighted averages:

Including a data from previous events and weight them.

vt = Beta Vt-1 + (1-Beta) Theta t 
Exp: 

V0 = 0
V1 = 0.9 V0 + 0.1 01

Theta = current data point

- Gradient Descent with Momentum

Compute weighted average and use that gradient to update your weight instead.

It help taking bigger steps toward the steep direction of the loss curvature

Vdw = B VdW + (1-B) dW
W := W - a VdW, b:= b - a VdB

The Global Average Pooling (GAP) is preferred over Global Max Pooling (GMP) because GAP helps us in identifying the full extent of the object as compared to the GMP layer, which identifies one discriminative part. In Global Average Pooling, an average is taken across all the activation maps which help us to find all the possible discriminative regions present in them. Contrary to this, the Global Max Pooling method just considers the most discriminative region. Hence, Global Average Pooling showed better results than Global Max Pooling.

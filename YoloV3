It devide the picture into grid as specified by user, each grid will have number of anchors within it, thus will yield tensor of (3,3 which is grid size, NO anchors, 5 which is x,y, w, h, c and number of classes)
E.x. [PC, Bx, By, Bh, Bw, c1, c2, c3, PC, Bx, By, Bh, Bw, c1, c2, c3] # 2 number of anchor, Pc is the probability

The anchors depict bounding box, the threshold of each bounding box will applied. 

Non-max supression per class so the one with high IOU number will remain and others will be trimed.
The triming will be if both bounding box have same class with high IOU.

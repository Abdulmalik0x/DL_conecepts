In RoI pooling, after getting the bbox of proposed objects, qunatization happen to get the offset location of each bbox, the rounding happeining is causing distortion 
to the actual location by marginal distance if the area is not divisible by the booling factor later, here what RoI align is solving.

It dividing the proposed bbox into small grids and doing intrpolation
